GCHQ Christmas Puzzle

It's obviously a QR code, you can tell by the 7's creating the boxes in the top right, bottom left etc. From the size of the Grid it's a Version 2 25x25 QR code.

"input.txt" is the raw puzzle input, "human" is with the intuitave parts of a QR manually annotated to save the solver some time. The 3x QR registation symbols are added, as well as the minimum keepout and the alternating stripes between registrations. On a code of this size there are no additionall tracking boxes.

Solver will fill in candidate solutions until the totals sum correctly, and maybe also cherck the QR checksum calculations?
